# Agent to Agent : a2

The a2 framework is a TypeScript-based library designed for building, orchestrating, and connecting AI-powered agents. It provides a flexible and extensible foundation for creating applications that leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI components.

## Key Features

- **Agent-Centric:** Build autonomous agents with customizable instructions, goals, and roles.
- **Modular Design:** Utilize components like Memory, Tools, and Resources to enhance agent capabilities.
- **Extensible:** Easily integrate custom AI models, memory systems, and tools.
- **Workflow Orchestration:** Define and execute complex workflows involving multiple agents and steps.
- **Process Management:** Create processes that coordinate multiple agents and workflows working together.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Enable agents to communicate and work together within processes.
- **Vercel AI SDK Integration:** Seamlessly works with the Vercel AI SDK for LLM interaction.
- **Typesafe:** Built with TypeScript for robust type checking and improved developer experience.

## Process & Multi-Agent System

The a2 framework allows you to create sophisticated multi-agent systems where:

- Multiple agents can work together in a coordinated process
- Each agent can handle different aspects of a complex task
- Workflows can be chained and executed in parallel or sequence
- Agents can share information and collaborate through a shared process context
- Process orchestration handles agent communication and workflow execution

## Installation

Install the core a2 framework package using npm or pnpm:
